# Deep Learning (AMSE)

## Overview

Many important questions in economics remain unanswered, partly because the data necessary to address them is encoded into high-dimensional data structures such as images or text. Applied economists have become increasingly interested in using deep learning models to transform these data into simpler representations, which can be used as inputs for subsequent economic analysis. After introducing predictive modelling, this course provides a comprehensive understanding of neural network models, as well as some of the most capable structures to process image and language data. While grounded in theory and mathematical formalisation, the course emphasizes intuitive understanding and practical implementation using Python.

## Outline

1. **Neural networks**: Predictive modelling, Regularisation, Neural networks, Backpropagation  
2. **Image modelling**: Image data, Image processing, Convolutional networks, Representations  
3. **Language modelling**: Text data, Embeddings networks, Recurrent networks, Transformers
